- Your app should list all todo tasks - completed or uncompleted
- You should be able to mark an uncompleted task as complete (and change it back to uncomplete)
- You should be able to add and remove tasks âœ…
- Your app should show a count of either all todos, or all uncomplete todos (or both) âœ…

- Add a timestamp for each task indicating when it was created. Timestamp should be displayed as formatted date, but stored as raw date. You can either use built in JS functionalities or [moment.js](https://momentjs.com/)
- Add a **complete all** button to set all tasks as completed. You could also use this opportunity to make your app look nice when there's no data. SeeÂ [empty states UX design](https://www.toptal.com/designers/ux/empty-state-ux-design)Â for some ideas.
- Use styled-components instead of vanilla CSS to do your styling
