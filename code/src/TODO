- Add a **complete all** button to set all tasks as completed. You could also use this opportunity to make your app look nice when there's no data. SeeÂ [empty states UX design](https://www.toptal.com/designers/ux/empty-state-ux-design)Â for some ideas. âœ…
- Use styled-components instead of vanilla CSS to do your styling
