# Daily help - A redux todo-app

The goal of this project was to build a todo app using Redux store.

## Features

- Redux hooks: useSelector, useDispatch, useSTate, useRef
- Ternary operators to handle empty states
- Timestap added using moment.js
- Filtered todos
- Summary componant that counts completed todos and uncompleted
- Responsive UI for mobile, tablet and desktop

## Production process

I started with sketching up the design in Figma and then splitted the work into smaller user stories on a Trello board.
